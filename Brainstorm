At some point, unbeknownst to the players, they will see future versions

Incldue a 'choose your own adventure' story for either the nobody or scion

Does the Scion lay out a plans ala Civ. (turn based) and then the nobody's 
module play out against that? At least until they meet personally? Does this
mean that the module creation (ar at least monster distribution and the laying
of plans) is a collaborative process with the GM? 
 
Jakata Stories about the Nobody. (short stories about his previous lives and 
the lessons learned therein)
