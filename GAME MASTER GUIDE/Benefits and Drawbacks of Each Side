The Benefits and Drawbacks of each side the Scion and the Nobody

NOBODY - instrumental in bringing about the next stage of human 
evolution and development. This is a gift and a service.

+ 
unkillable
invulnerable
omnipotent
trust is good
having a deeper access to his past incarnations allows him to 
quickly 'relearn' material rather than having to start from 
scratch (study time bonus)

-
alone
unbelieved
working class
unaware of situation
As the nobody ascends he more intimately connects with the 
egregore hivemind meaning he loses his psychic privacy. 

Because there are many of them and he is all alone there are 
more targets for him to strike. He might not be able to 
specifically hit you, but he can hit your faction and your
factions real estate, capital, and processes.

SCION - the nobody is dealing with unknowns and is an 
existential threat to humanity. the nobody is a change for 
the worse and a threat.
+
wealthy
gigantic social network
collaborators can be killed
omniscient
knowledge of the Nobody
A few years older then the Nobody he gets a "this lifetime" 
headstart.

-
trust is bad
The scion degrades physically and mentally all at once w/o 
constant and ever more costly age inhibition treatments.

BOTH
The power (promotion/ascension)  and dangers (
downfall/hubris)  of PSI et. al.
Transhumanism vs Victorian England
trust is good (nobody) vs. trust is bad (scion)
Scion lost his mother, while the nobody lost his father 
(i'm thinking he's going to have to lose his mother just before the first mentor)
	this means that the scion is motivated to fight for the girl because of the loss of his own mother
	the nobody will cleave towards the mentors due to the loss of his father

if the nobody says anything about them he seems crazy, if they say anything about him, they do. 

Scion = math, western philosophy
Nobody = music, eastern philosophy
