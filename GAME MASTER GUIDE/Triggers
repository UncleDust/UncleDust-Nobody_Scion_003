TRIGGERS 

FILE CREATED: 12/19/2018

Objects, encounters, events, and information are triggers (with a small 
`t').

Each trigger is assigned a stressor level in addition to its special type. 

Depending on the special type the player uses their abilities (native and/
or in-game (based on defensive choices, i.e. skill tree branches) to make a 
decision and cope with the stressor. 

See SAVING THROWS

Triggered (with a capital `T') is the word used to describe a player 
character having a sort of STATE-ACTIVATION. It can be likened to a 
Berserker rage and will both give the player a new set and/or type of 
abilities as well as a temporary upgrade in overall abilities. Some triggers
cause the loss (temporary, but this is a secret from the players when it 
happens) of sets or types of abilities.
