HUBRIS, SIN & PHYSICAL SHORTCOMING

FILE CREATED: 12/19/2018

Gotta include motivation for each in addition to their human foibles. 

EVERY CHARACTER HAS AN ACHILLES HEEL. A SECRET, AN OVERWHELMING
TRIGGER, A SHORTCOMING...A FATAL FLAW THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED
AND EXPLOITED.

In addition to HUBRIS there is also, possibly, a physical defect of some 
sort.
