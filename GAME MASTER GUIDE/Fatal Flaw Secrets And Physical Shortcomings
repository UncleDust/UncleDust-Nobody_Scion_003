Gotta include motivation for each in addition to their human foibles. 

EVERY CHARACTER HAS AN ACHILLES HEEL. A SECRET, AN OVERWHELMING
TRIGGER, A SHORTCOMING...A FATAL FLAW THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED
AND EXPLOITED.

In addition to HUBRIS there is also, possibly, a physical defect of some 
sort. 

FATAL FLAW is a shortcoming that determines the types of triggers a 
character has. 

SECRET is a character flaw (sin or trauma) that effects the character's persona and, by
extension, their story in some way.

PHYSICAL SHORTCOMING affects some physical elements game play, some social 
interactions, and some of the psychological attacks. 


FATAL FLAW

The fatal flaw is one of the (originally) 8 deadly sins. 

	LUST


	GLUTTONY


	GREED


	SLOTH


	WRATH


	ENVY


	PRIDE


	DEPRESSION


SECRET

SECRET is a personalized bit of back story that causes guilt or shame on the 
part of the player. It may also make him vulnerable in some way. The secret 
is customized by the GM for each player character and will remain a weak 
point for him until he cultivates the attributes and / or skills neccesary
to overcome the handicap caused by it. The player might also find a way 
to overcome this liability with some sort of in-game behavior or strategy. 
The GM might also come up with a specialized campaign to fix this. 


PHYSICAL SHORTCOMINGS

Just as the BODY TYPE affects physical attributes, PHYSICAL SHORTCOMINGS
does to as stated earlier some physical shortcomings will also influence
CHARISMA and some types of PSYCHOLOGICAL abilities.
