GODS

The potential relationship that a player has with the gods is one that
can bring great power, but is also fraught with danger. The power comes
from gifts, and boons granted by the God in question to a player that has
made offerings, sworn allegiance, or serves the agenda of the god in question. The danger comes from betraying, slighting (on purpose and 
on accident), or standing in the way of a god's wishes.
