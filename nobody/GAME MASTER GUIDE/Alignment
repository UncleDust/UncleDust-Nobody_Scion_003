ALIGNMENT

Alignment is a scale that is ranges from order to chaos [#TBD]

This scale determines if the Scion has succesfully subverted the Nobody
and in some cases if the Nobody has converted the Scion. This is one of the
(but, not the only) Victory conditions for the game. 

How close their scales are to one another is also used to determine whether
the cooperative or no quarter branch is followed. 

It might be a cross axis with one axis being order and chaos 
and the second axis being sensitivity and agression...or something.
