MOVEMENT AND ENCUMBERANCE

"Just moving down the sidewalk to go get a cup of coffee 
can be like executing a complex football play."

Maybe, use slots instead of weights --a backpack has so 
many slots, pockets, coat, etc. 

items are 
small - fits in a pocket
medium - fits only in large pocket
large - need a seperate bag or bag's pouch
oversized - held in hands, slung over body, or seperate and dedicated case
giant - need dolly, or vehicle (tow wagon) to move
mammoth - crane, tow truck, etc
gargantuan - airplane, ship, train, etc
