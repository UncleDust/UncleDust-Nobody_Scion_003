The Power of Stewardship

GENRE BEND: 1950s Military training manual - Headstart preschool book 


You're great great great grandfather was a Texas Ranger. We don't know
his real name because someone in the family stole the grave marker that
had it along with the Ranger Star on it. But, he was a Ranger. This would 
have been back in the days when they were still going around alone or with 
a single partner. They would ride into a town that was completely lawless,
with whorehouses and too much crime and they would be given the authority
to do whatever they needed to uphold law and order. 

When he was a little baby he was kidnapped by the indians and they raised
him as one of their own. Now his mother got very sad about this and she 
went to a man that owned the biggest ranch in that part of Texas and 
because he was influential and connected he had some pull with the local 
band of Commanches. So, to make him help her she went to him and gave him
a very expensive saddle with lots of those silver conch shells on them. No, 
I don't know how she got it only that their family was well off enough to 
be able to give him the bribe. 

He agreed to help and he went off and found the Indians and the boy, but
there was an woman that had grown attached to him and considered 
him her own son now. The man wanted to keep the saddle with the conch 
shells and he was able to convince the tribe to convince her to give 
him the boy, but she made it a condition that the boy would come back
and live with her for a few months at a time and that's how he learned 
to be a cowboy and a scout at the same time and that's how come when he
got older he had a wife and mistress. He had grown accustomed to having
two women fight for his love and companionship.

"Your grandmother got into a fight with a witch in a nearby town. Her head
spun around and her tongue stretched down to her knees. She doesn't like to
talk about it."

They stop at the old man's house on the way to the ranch. 

The Nobody is forced to kill a man here and this is his Achille's heel / Moses 
moment that the Scion (or someone else?) will use against him later on.

[1981]

You spent the afternoon packing the car with the suitcases and boxes you had
spent the night before packing. You and your mom hit the freeway at sundown. 
The city lights disappeared behind you and only the long black ribbon and the
occasional 18 wheeler. 

The next morning was bright red sunlight and desert. 

"There's Phoenix."

Your mother didn't believe in taking very many breaks. There was a
non-descript rest stop made of concrete and wood; bathrooms and picnic tables.
There was the diner that sparkled of shiny steel and glittered with blue and 
orange formica. The honey bears made of translucent plastic wearing bright 
yellow plastic hats on each table. 

"There's Tuscon."

You ate sandwiches as you drove and she told you stories of how she had met 
your father before the war at a dance, what your grandfather was like, and 
how she remembered the city she grew up that she hadn't seen in over 13 years 
--just before she had moved with your grandmother to San Diego to join your 
father who was stationed there before being transferred to Okinawa, Japan and 
then Vietnam. The governer of Texas had given your grandmother on your father's
side an award for having the most children in one family serve in the military.
For a state like Texas this was a big deal. He ended up sending an assistant
of some sort. There was an award and picture and story you saw in a newspaper
clipping that was sent to your mother. 

The car overheated and there was the stop at the gas station to get the
radiator's hose and coolant replaced. 

"There's El Paso."

It was smaller there then you had imagined it to be. El Paso was famous. It was
mentioned in millions of movies and songs and here it was now, a sparse 
collection of dusty ramshackle buildings. A boot store. And then like the other
towns that you were unable to stop in. It was gone. 

"Here's San Antonio."

You spent the day in San Antonio with an Uncle that worked for some sort of 
business having to do with the Army. Your aunt and cousins took you to the 
River Walk and you visited the Alamo. It was much smaller then you thought it 
would be too. You were struck by how many soldiers were walking around, one of
your cousins made a joke about how you could always tell the soldiers by their
haircuts and the way walked in unison --even when they were out of uniform.

[#The first of the "Two Types of Texan Story"; friendly, helpful, kind]

You drove east and south towards the Gulf of Mexico. Your mom was going to
visit her brother in Galveston but first she was going to drop you off with 
your Uncle Joe somewhere in the middle of this featureless dead greyness.

"This is going to be fun for you. Your Uncle Joe is really looking forward to 
spend some time with you. He says the two of you are going to have a lot of 
fun. You'll get to learn how to hunt."

This sounds like a fun idea to you, but your friends had made sure to impress
upon you how gruesome skinning animals was just before you had left. 
Appearantly, it was very important to not hit the 'shit sack' with your knife
when doing this or you would ruin all the meat of your kill.

Occasionally you would see a rabbit run across the road. There were deer
antlers over the entranceways of most buildings and rifle racks seemed to be
a requirement. 

[#the second of "The Two Types of Texan"; mean, suspicious, weird.]

Your Uncle Joe is your grandmother's brother and he had been in the Marines 
just like your father. He had recently retired and moved back to Texas from 
Oceanside, California. 

At the end of a long driveway that leads away from the main highway is your Uncle
Joe's home. It is a small dwelling with a kitchen, living room, bathroom, bed
room, and guest room. 

Your Uncle Joe is standing in the front yard surrounded by various concrete
statues of mythical creatures and rusting vehicles and equipment. A triangle and
its striking rod hang off the veranda. Antlers over the entrance. A truck. A dog.

He is a short man of about 5 feet and six inches. He is built like a proverbial
fire plug and walks slightly bow-legged. He speaks with a long drawl and his eyes
are of a fiery hazel. He has a star shaped scar on his lower right jawline. The 
story of this scar was told to you by your mother sometime between El Paso and
San Antonio. 

THE STORY OF UNCLE JOE'S STAR SHAPED JAWLINE SCAR

Uncle Joe had been sent to the peninsula during the Korean War of the 1950s. One
day while his platoon was on patrol they were ambushed by the enemy and a
battle took place, during which most of his fellow soldiers were killed and he 
was shot in the face while engaging in hand-to-hand combat. 

He was left for dead and laid in the snow until he regained consciousness and 
crawled to a nearby field hospital. There they were triaging the wounded and 
dividing them into two groups. The first group was composed of soldiers that could
be saved and the second of soldiers for who there was no hope. My uncle was put
into the second group and someone even pulled a sheet over his eyes, but again he
got up and crawled over to the first group. Again, he was placed in the second
group and again he crawled back over to the first group. This time he was operated
on and survived. 

And that's the story of Uncle Joe's Star Shaped Jawline Scar. There were two other
stories that your mom shared about him. Although they were less stories and more 
by way of descriptive character sketches. 

Apparently, because he was a "lifer" he had been able to rise through the ranks of
enlisted men to the rank of Master Gunnery Sargeant, but had been busted down a 
few stripes for hitting an officer. He eventually regained those stripes. 

The second story was how his brother who was also a Marine didn't enjoy going out
with him to bars because "He always starts fights." Joe's response to this is that
he never started a fight without a valid reason and most of the family agreed with
this. Still though, he was known to have an uncanny propensity to justifiably 
express violence upon the deserving and persistent.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION
(To be read by Game Master to Player)

The nearest town [#name - something with 'ville' or 'burg' in it] is a small collection
of buildings a 30 minute drive away. 

Uncle Joe's property is bordered by four other properties: 
1) A good neighbor and friend.
2) An antagonistic neighbor. 
3) A neutral isolationist character [the curandera?]
4) An aloof and wealthy owner of a gigantic ranch (vampire)

It is late Feb and still cold although warming. The weather is a crisp 40 - 50 F daytime
and 25 - 35 in the evening. The bright sky matches the icy ground and it's overcast grey 
amplifies a sense of vast emptiness. Even though it is noontime you can see your own
breath condense with every exhale.

There is the sound of crows and wind through dead rushes and impenetrable thicket.

Uncle Joe's residence lies to one edge of his [?] acre property. Your mother honks at 
the gate at the end of the road that passed at least two other properties with their
residences. Uncle Joe comes running out a little bit older and a little bit slower then
you remember him during his visit to California about 7 years ago. 

EXTERIOR UNCLE JOE'S RESIDENCE

1: Driveway

Two high gates that swing inward with the symbol of Uncle Joe's property over it. 
There are 3 flags fluttering from a 30' flagpole; United States, Texas, and 
the USMC.

The driveway terminates with the residence to one side and a large garage /
workshop at its end. 

2: Garage / Workshop

Large, rolling doors cover this garage and workshop. In here are tools for wood
working, automotive repair, metal working, etc. 

After greeting you he helps carry the luggage that will support you for the next 2
months. 

INTERIOR UNCLE JOE'S RESIDENCE

1) Veranda

A large veranda up off the ground and even with the floor level of the house. It is 
enclosed with thin glass and wind screens and furnished with a sofa, some chairs, 
and a long coffee table. It is "mostly used for sleeping in during hot summer 
nights". 

2) Foyer

A small foyer to keep out the cold and wet and keep in the heat and dry. This 
residence has no air conditioning. A place for pendeltons, denim jackets, cowboy
hats and baseball caps. There is an upside down horseshoe over the door --"To
make sure the good luck doesn't spill out!"

3) Living Room

Seperated from the nearby Dining Room by a low half wall that has various models
of USMC aircraft ("Those are some of the aircraft I worked on when I was in the 
service.") hanging by fishing line over it. There is a sofa, lazy boy, large cabinet 
television and another cabinet record player / radio, a telephone on a table, a 
coffee table, in the corner a mini bar. Various paintings, crucifixes, and Tex-Mex
folk art. An electric heater, more deer antlers, and a well stocked rifle rack. 

4) A Hallway

Photographs on the walls of this hallway along with storage cabinets along one wall
and more art, memoribilia and curios on top of them for decoration. 

5) The Guest Bedroom

Nothing more then a bed with two pillows, a couple of blankets, and an empty
closet. "I cleaned this out so you'd have plenty of room."

6) Bedroom

This is Joe's bedroom. A bed, a chest of drawers, a sea trunk, a Navajo blanket
on a wall, there is a bit of a crowded feeling in this room and you realize it's 
because he's moved some things in here to clear out the guest bedroom. A 
closet with a hasp lock on it (Joe keeps the key on a necklace he never
removes).

7) Bathroom
