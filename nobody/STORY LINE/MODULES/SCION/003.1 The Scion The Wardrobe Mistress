Appearantly, she had been a perfect fit for the job. The job listing had been for a 
wardrobe assistant and her security clearance from her stint in Air Force psychological 
operations was easily renewed. She worked moving from base to base wardrobing
crisis actors for military and law enforcement training. She enjoyed the work because
it wasn't very different from her work in the film industry. There were scripts with 
characters and stories. The looks were always different and so creatively she felt
challenged. She liked the job security. It was an extremely long gig and she 
had been at it for about a year. This was much better than having to jump from music 
video to commercial to television pilots. She had even worked on a porn shoot once. 
But, it was the constant search for work that she found wearing on her soul. Another
thing that was troublesome was never knowing what kind of a set she would be working
on. Sometimes it would be a multi-million dollar budget, but other times it would be 
only gas station restrooms and convinience store coffee at 2 in the morning. This job
wasn't like that. There were long hours sure, but they were in line with some of the 
union shows she had worked on and the budget that her department had was more 
than enough for the things that they (she worked closely with teams of special effects
make up artists) had to do. 

She was good at what she did. On many occasions she was singled out for praise by
this training drill's commander or another. Her wardrobes were extremely realistic.
Even people trained in observation marveled at how undetectable her handiwork was, 
the manner in which it aided in the quality of the simulations due to its seamless
immersiveness its utter appropriatness. 

On one occasion she had been personally responsible for a group of about 200 extras
that had to represent rioting civilians. In 3 days time she had measured each person, 
created personas, and pulled clothing and accesories from the two semi-truck trailers
that followed them around the country. She enjoyed putting pants with shirts and
jackets or sweaters, hats, etc on individual hangars. Then bagging them in clear plastic
before finally filling out a cardboard tag with a sharpie and pinning them to the outside
of each to identify the actor and their persona.
