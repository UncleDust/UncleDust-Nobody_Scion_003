The Scion - Bardo

"She's jumped again."
"You mean she's dead."
"Yes. If the Entity follows its previous patterns it will remain in 
Bardo for a bit before reincarnating."
"Six months still?"
[Magic 8-ball quote]
"Have any of the precogs figured out where yet?"
"No."
"Keep the teeps on stuff and inform me when something changes."
And with that he hung up the phone and stared into the crib at his 
first born son.

A picture: The father brings the infant scion out of the bedroom
and raises it high over his head; grandmother in her walker clapping. 

Mother is dead.
