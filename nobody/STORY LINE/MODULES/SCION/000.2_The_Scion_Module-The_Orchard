000.1 The Scion Modules - The Orchard

[# 1971]


The rental car at the airport. The Imperial Le Baron. It 
was good to be able to stretch out after the cramped
airliner. The seats were orange and yellow vinyl. He 
found himself unable to appreciate the new style. The
interior of the rental car was black and shiny. 

He drive down the highway.

Then there was old town with its small familiar buildings
made of brick. 

That church. 

Then there was more highway until the brick wall, the 
wrought iron 
gate. 

Past the gate and Into the orchard. 

The Orchard.

Pull into the parking lot; inhale deeply. 

Soft crunch of loose gravel.

Another thin lozenge of 
nicotine gum (he has a colleague in pharmaceuticals in 
Sweden) and another deep inhaltion of the salted air and
finds that he is sitting at a table inside the house of Herbert 
Goodman, the adminstrator of this grove of trees, their 
buildings and all contents therein. Most important among
these contents are his juvenille charges.

	HERBERT GOODMAN

 He is a combination of Aristotle and Robin Williams. His psychic defenses 
are his bigest trait due to the poltergeist effects on the part of some of the 
naturals (most significantly the Scion). 

"She's a great girl. Really spectacular in every single way. She's young and 
she's got a long way to go, but we're optimistically hopeful that she'll be 
able to measure up. There is one thing though she can tend to be a little...
that is...[#fatalFlaw]."


Across the table from them are two of the staff; one, an instructor, the
other serves as floor mother the Scion lives on. 


	THE INSTRUCTOR

The instructor is a small man with pale freckled skin, wavy red hair and 
a prominent nose. He wears a sweater vest, corderoys, and reading 
glasses hang around his neck. 

"She has the demeanor of a girl twice her age. She's speaks and has the 
manner of a teenager instead of the child she still is. In addition to this, 
as we have already discussed, she is naturally gifted and performs on par
with adults in many ways apropos to our areas of concern. But, because
of this physical and psychic maturity I  must reiterate that it is easy to 
forget she is still very much a child in her intra-psychic and social 
development. Of particular note is...[#physicalShortcoming]"


	THE FLOOR MOTHER

"It's bothersome having to always be on guard around such a young child.
If I'm not vigilant at all times she is able to walk up silently --I cannot feel her
approach [#Targeted Sensory Perception Dampening ]. In other instances 
she  has intruded my thought stream (past my casual defenses) and giggled 
before breaking off[#mindreading #intrusiveThought]. On one occasion she 
scolded me for having what she deemed a 'strange' dream. [#DreamPeeping ]. 
I've been around her and her entire set of classmates for the last 8 years and 
there's something that you should be aware of...[#Secret]."

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

He has decided to leave the car behind and make his way through the grove 
towards the inner wall. He smiles at the guard and enters the Academy grounds 
with it's irregular clusters of white buildings, gardens, the clock tower. 

The familar sounds of the ocean clearly audible now.  The perfect lawns, the
breeze, the bright and clean sunlight. According to the clock tower classes were
in session and other then the occasional administrator or groundskeeper he 
had the walk to the stairs completely to himself. 

He stared out into the ocean from this high vantage point. The gulls sailed by
and he could make out terns running across thin foam, pebble-strewn shoreline. 

He can't see her. He wants to see her. But, there is a new sand wall between him
and the far end of the beach. His leather soles scratch their way down and half
way down he sits, removes them, and lays them to the side. 

He is on the beach and approaching the sand wall. Soon he will be with her. 

*HELLO, JONATHYN. HERB SAID YOU'D BE ARRIVING TODAY. * 
[#telepathy, #sensePresence]

He is still walking and smiles inwardly and sends it towards her. 

*I'M RIGHT OVER HERE.*

He has turned the corner and she is standing over an open pit filled with water left
over from the last high tide. There is kelp and her towel. 

*HOW'S IT GOING, KIDDO? I'VE MISSED YOU.*

She doesn't turn her head and she is staring into the pit and she is waving her hand in
tight circles. The corpse of an albatross swirls before her. 

*AH. FEELS WEIRD.*

*YES.*

*LEAVE THAT ALONE. COME HERE. I'VE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING."

And he kneels down and snaps the springs of his briefcase open. 

And she turns and leaves that thing alone and walks towards him.
