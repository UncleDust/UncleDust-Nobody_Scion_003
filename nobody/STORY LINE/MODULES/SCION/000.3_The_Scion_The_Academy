000 The Scion Module: Lawyer Dad and Baby Cub
(The Power of Inheritance)


FOR GM EYES ONLY: 

OVERVIEW 
This college-prepratory academy / childrens school  is located on a 
Maryland coastline cliff. It was founded 100 years ago in 1878. It is 
secluded and well protected. 

The students are told that school property ends at the nearby brush
line on the southern side and steep rocky mountains to the north. 
They are told that the school is only about 40 square acres in size
and that the area surrounding it is owned by the State Parks agency
and an oil refinery and they must stay off those areas or risk 
expulsion. In fact, the Academy is several times bigger and owns
hundreds of acres surrounding the school's complex of buildings.

The grounds are divided into two main areas: 

THE ORCHARD - This is where the action of 000 takes place in the 
childhood portion of the Scion's life. This is the area meant for 
Illuminati children. 

THE ACADEMY -  This is where the action of [TBD] takes place in
the teenage years of the Scion's life.

There is a small airport 10 miles past the small town that is 30 miles
up the freeway. The freeway is a 15 minute drive from the school's 
gates. The surrounding areas are farmland.

It's secluded here. It's meant to be.

GAME PLAY  - THE ORCHARD


GAME PLAY - THE ACADEMY

Day [TBD]

In a classroom. Mr Cook is giving a short lecture on Spartan society in
particular the Lacedaemonian (Spartan) and their annual war against their 
_helots_ (slave/serf class) by their _Crypteia_ (secret police) that all
future leaders were expected to participate in. During this "war" _kryptes_
(agents) would be instructed to roam the countryside and kill any helots
they encountered and take anything they wanted. They were encouraged to kill
the strongest and best of the helots to prevent rebellions and cow the 
remaining slave population.
