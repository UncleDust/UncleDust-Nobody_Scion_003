THE IN-BETWEEN

WHAT IS THE IN-BETWEEN?

The in-between is the space that lies between the wild and the civilized --the natural world and the man-made
one.

This space is physical because it is what we move through. But, in actuality, the in-between is nowhere. 

We are material beings made of flesh and bone. We  move through time from conception, infancy, childhood,
into adulthood before finally dying and returning  to the dust. 
We call this experience of rate...time. 
Because of where man is located in relation to a star we experience the divisions of seasons, days, weeks,
months, years, minutes, hours, seconds, etc. 

The in-between is beyond the man-made divisions of time, but it is also beyond the seasons and the movements
of the stars. 

Time does not exist in the in-between. 

The in-between is a god-realm. 
The in-between is extra-dimensional. 
The in-between is a source of our human and material existence. 
The in-between is experienced beyond the mundane senses, 
by the intuition, imagination, and emotions.
