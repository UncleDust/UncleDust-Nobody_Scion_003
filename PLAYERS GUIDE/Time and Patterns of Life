						TIME AND PATTERNS OF LIFE

Following the design philosophy of playability over superfluous mechanics
the concept of TIME is treated rather fluidly.


	GAME PLAY PASSAGE OF TIME IS STRUCTURED AROUND THE PASSAGE 
	OF DAYS.


After the general map, cast, and background of a module is laid out
then the play progresses on a daily basis. The GM will have a schedule
that will track the progress of time as the players progress through the
day's action and events. 


	PATTERNS OF LIFE


In addition to this there is the concept of PATTERNS OF LIFE. 
For the most part there is a repetition in the affairs of our day to 
day life that tend to repeat for weeks, months, years, and, in some cases, 
decades at a time. Consider what you do on a daily basis: is there not
a predictable regularity to most of the affairs in your personal life? Do
you not wake, shower, dress, drive, work, shop, eat, and entertain yourself
in predictable patterns?

The modules take this state of affairs into account and adventures take 
place within this construct. 


	TIME JUMPS


TIME JUMPS also occcur. This means that in-between modules are explained 
to the Player by the GM and any changes undergone by the character in 
experience, work, travel, etc. are simply awarded or deducted and are 
accepted as part of the game's experience by the player. 

Time jumps can also be experienced within a module for the purposes of moving
action along and in cases of TIME MAGIC or a particularly strong REALITY
DISTORTION FIELD.
