PLAYER CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES

FILE CREATED: 12/19/2018

CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES 

PHYSICAL ABILITIES:
The player choses (or rolls random) for 
	1) body type (ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph)
	2) Height

These two things determine the following physical attributes:
	Strength
	Agility
	Flexibility
	Endurance
	Reflexes

Hand/Eye cordination and Reflexes are a TBD combination of the mental 
abilities CONCENTRATION and AWARENESS with STRENGTH/ENDURANCE and AGILITY/
FLEXIBILITY respectively.

MENTAL/INTRA-PSYCHIC: 

This is the important part. This is base structure that determines game
play. The scores in each of these attributes is what affects the probability
of success for the supra-mundane elements of The Nobody and The Scion.

It is true that most people have the potential for psychic and/or magical
abilities in much the same way that it is true that the game of basketball
can be taught to anyone in an afternoon or two. But, the analogy must be
extended to its natural conclusion: there is a difference between high
school and college levels of competition, even more so between college
and professional. And yet, even at the highest levels of professional
competition there are only a small handful of "stars" and among these
an even fewer number of truly legendary players. 

The Nobody and the Scion are legendary level characters, but there are 
other equally powerful non-player characters and what less powerful 
characters lack in ability they compensate for in numbers and frequency.
defensive measures, and responsive triggers? 

CONCENTRATION:

also is the ability to filter out extranous stimuli and focus attention on 
the chosen object.

	SAVING THROW vs. DISTRACTION

AWARENESS: 
This is similar to CONCENTRATION, but subtly differnent in that it is the
AWARENESS that one is concentrating on something. Without AWARENESS, 
concentration can easily devolve into trance or fugue. The subtypes of 
AWARENESS are: 

	1) Environment
	2) Self
	3) Other
