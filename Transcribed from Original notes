The beginnings of the RPG based on the struggle between a scion of the illuminati and the Nobody.


NOTES

The Nobody D&D style attributes
"Invisible Armies" style traumas and a de-emphasis on violence. 
Age jumps in between modules
Each side gets a mentor (or series of mentors) Scion gets his father and extended family and the Nobody gets various strangers. 
Information assymetry
In spite of it's emphasis on non-violence this game is _suprisingly_ruthless_.
Inspired by PKD and Charles Bukowski.

This isn't just a role-playing game it's also literature, drama, and a whole bunch of other stuff too.
But, yeah, literature and drama. So, what might seem like "railroading" or limited and forced 
choices really isn't. There will be many branching points and multiple outcomes. I do have a vision 
and a story to tell so....{what?}

If anybody says anything about the Nobody they seem crazy and if he says anything about them, he does.
