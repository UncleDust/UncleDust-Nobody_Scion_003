PROLOGUE
aka Jules Has a Dream

	He shook his head and stars fell from his antlers. One of his
legs extended and bent at the knee, the other leg curled underneath
himself, supporting him; one arm with its elbow locked and supporting
him, the other resting atop his knee. 
	He stared through green clouds, impossibly shifting lines, swirls 
of moving light. 

	He was serene, composed, and eternal. 

	His opposite sat (fitingly) across from him. His shimmering throne
supporting his gargantuan frame. His skin red and glistening with nebulas
and galaxies. He pulled on his pipe. Its cherry glowing; shades of purple
and burgundies as he drank from his cup their shared realm filled with 
music that to our mortal and human ears would seem like the crash of ocean
waves, the paper wingbeats of birds, the echoing laughter of a stadium of
children. 

	"Shall we play another?" the latter asked the former. "You almost 
won the last one didn't you?" the former replied in calm repose. "Hmph."
replied the red-skinned one,"The same initials as the last?" "As you 
wish." And then the one with thin strands of etheral gossamer threaded
through his horns extended an appendage, he cast his net across the 
playing area and with a flash of light it jerked and spread taut between
them. The nets jewels sparkled and flashed through the darkness.

I. The Opening

	Time, matter, structure, energy, coherence, expressive chaos, implied
entropy; the dialectic of bipolarity and its infinite gradations subtle and
gross the preliminary playthings of the two God_Monsters.

K'bah-lin; The Antlered
K'bah-lin; the One that Moves in Radiant Splendour Between Spaces and is
Beyond Time. 
K'bah-lin; The Great Architect, Builder, and Master Technician moved first. 

He created innumerable helper-agents; each a node, each an object, each one 
his tool & instrument and with a flourish assigned them. 

Vlankoor Tuh hHat; He That Laughs Alone in the Darkness
Vlankoor Tuh hHat; The Fractured, The Hobbled, The Hairy
Vlankoor Tuh hHat; The Red One responded. He did he create a large pile 
of his own. He divided this pile into many smaller piles at regular
intervals on his side. The he walked along, kicking each of them
across the Game in large, arcing, billows of Dust.
	
	Then did K'bah-lin clap all of his hands and they sat atop their 
mounts. For an intermable measure they each stared into it as it moved
in and indescribable manner that they each found delight in. 

	Some of the swarms of dust formed into stellar nurseries spitting stars
some formed into swirling or barred galaxies, some coalesced into planets.
There were supernovas, and gaping holes that sunk into the net threatening
to tear and rip. 

	More time passed and the two of them were lost in the Contemplation,
each stoically gazing; drowsy and droopy-lided.

	The Agents of the Radiant Splendour set and held most of the celestial 
objects in their place, but Vlankoor Tuh hHat exerted his will (nothing is
to be still, nothing in its final place) and probed for the neglected.
	
	"Your concentration wanes very soon."

	The Horned God-Monster motioned to one of his attendants.The 
supernumerary glided forward with a giant chest of drawers. He opened,
spread, and expanded it out before his Master, his supernal.

	It took many ages for this process to finish and at the end of these
countless _kalpas_ K'bah-lin picked up a different artifact in each of his 
ten billion hands. He moved across the net and would occasionally hover over
a chosen globe of rock or gas or plasma. The most promising were within a 
set distance of star, but not always. Vlankoor Tuh hHat followed behind,
sometimes close and sometimes he would pause and wait far behind. But, he
always had the same purpose, always with his fiery third eye of destruction,
his third eye --chain-burning, cluster-reaping, enveloping & collapsing.

	"Lordap! Lordap is done and you have only a single globe remaining! No
chance! No chance!" shouted the Red and laughed in the direction of his
supporting retinue of 5 billion. "So you say." responded the Blue and he
stood up like a spreading fan and collapsed like a waterfall.

	Vlankoor Tuh hHat cowered.
	Vlankoor Tuh hHat shivered.
	Vlankoor Tuh hHat laughed. 

	He laughed because the best part (well, second best part hopefully)
was now starting. He laughed and clapped his hands. Oozing chthonicities
smeared upwards from the ground, then they hardened, and then they
exploded into an innumberable arrary of trinkets, baubles, glyphs, runes,
signs...game pieces. 

	Vlankoor Tuh hHat giggled.

	Vlankoor Tuh hHat giggled as the elder (but not the Eldest) 
gesture-willed the crystaline ceiling vaulting over their heads shatter int
innumberable shards, symbols, letters, musical notes, colors...game pieces. 

	And now came The Stillness into The Gathering into The Quickening. 

	The assembled quivered and shimmered and phased into and out of. On and
off, on and off they blinked in anticipation. 

	Fridanfh unrustled her tails and moved a small portion of her sensors
towards them and began to analyze and deconstruct from afar. She was mostly
disinterested, but still there was an elegant beauty in this one that was
not readily apparent. It was subtle. She broke off a piece of herself and 
then five others sending them into the All-Directions.

	Now because Vlankoor Tuh hHat ha issued the challenge and K'bah-lin had
accepted this meant that meeant that K'bah-Lin was the initator and as
the game's initiator it was (mostly) infused with his spirit. His net was
its fabric, and his agents were its laws and motivating forces. In games
past Vlankoor Tuh hHat had been the First Mover and it had been across his
sack cloth that its essence had moves, it was his dust that ruled
triumphant, his laws that drove all. But, that was then and this was now
and so Vlankoor Tuh hHat could but watch as K'bah-lin began to dance. 

	K'bah-lin's every movement was his will, his imaginings and his power
--kinetic expressive, movement emotive-- the crook in an ankle, the flutter
of his arms, his visage both stoic and serene. His celestial orchestra 
softly matching K'bah-lin's graceful movements on a thousand different 
instruments; wood, stringed, multi-stringed, pipes, winds, drums, bells,
pipes and when the two billion memeber choir began it's slow sub-vocal hum
Vlankoor Tuh hHat could be seen holding back tears! (This I know to be true
for I was there!)

	K'bah-lin glided towards an alarm clock and wound it. It's ticking 
filled the Great Hall and he slowly danced. He picked up a gleaming cube, 
each of its sides a different colored light and he began to dance a little
bit faster now and the music played a little bit faster and the choir went
audible; syllables, words, phrases, sentences, stanzas, until, finally, 
hymns of glory, hymns of creation, and through all of this K'bah-lin danced
and picked up musical instruments of his own, and tools for the creation of
things, the destruction of those same things, tools for beauty, survival, 
creation, deception, memory, healing, fucking, to create significance, 
convey authority, to chasten, to cleanse, celebration. 

	The globe between them was also changing. It cycled through several
types of hardness. It passed from heavy to light. It shifted and changed 
with each chosen tool. Sometimes a yellow mist would pass across it or it 
would suddenly change and be covered in ice. Sometimes it became more ovoid,
other times more spherical. It would glow white hot. At one point it even
appeared to grow spikes and turn a deep, dark shade of black. So black as 
to almost seem to disappear before it changed and became more visible
again.

	K'bah-lin finished his dance and the music faded into silence. Vlankoor Tuh
hHat and his entourage dutifuly oscillated up and down the visible light
spectrum demonstrating their appreciation of his craftsmanship for it was
excedingly admirable. The fiery glyph notations traced into the air by the 
scribes bore glowing witness to this. The portion of the great domed hall 
occupied by K'bah-lin and His dimmed to darkness and after awhile so did 
Vlankoor Tuh hHat's. Only the Grid remained, only the Grid bathed in the
dark radiance emanating from the sphere floating high above it. 

	The two spectral titans descended from their pedestals and into their
respective pools of light closeby the quivering Net of K'bah-lin. 
K'bah-lin's majordomo, once again, stepped forward, once again, wheeling the
giant chest of drawers, once again, did he relieve his master of his divine
accoutrements before gliding and disappearing, once again, into the 
all-engulfing darkness. Only K'bah-lin, Vlankoor Tuh hHat, and the faint
glow of the game scribes fire sigils hanging in the air. Only the Grid and
the Sphere. They studied their arrangement and it's movements.

	"A delightful opening." observed K'bah-lin and he lightly struck a corner of 
the playing space. He observed the gentle ripple that emanated from the
tip of his finger and across the warp and woof of the Game. "The spread is
flawless, if I may say so. Look how all three layers are completely 
superated --no ripping, warping, or sticking." It was true and Tuh hHat was
forced to admit as much. "It is good craftsmanship for certain.", he
replied,"The nodes are wide and deep. Plenty of room for piece placement." 
K'bah-lin sighed for he felt that he had surpassed mere technical
craftsmanship, he _felt_ something this time. He had briefly sublimed, he 
was sure. Vankloor leaned in closer and intently inspected the strands 
themselves; crossing and overlapping one another. "They are durable, 
robust. These connections will carry information very speedily." He clapped
his hands once as an expression of lusty contentment and as its bell-like
resonance crashed and reverberated K'bah-lin forgot the small sting of 
K'bah-lin's boorishness and smiled as he gazed upon the globe levitating
above them. "Yes, I must respectfully disagree with your earlier
comment. This is an even game." He could not help himself. 

	They stared a long time again for that had Eternity --enamored of their
cooperative creation--...spell-bound and ensorcelled.

II. The Middle 

	Because Vlankoor Tuh hHat was hot it was K'bah-lin that was cool, and 
because the middle-game could not start until one of them was _compelled_ 
to move, and because K'bah-lin was cool and Vlankoor Tuh hHat hot it was
Vlankoor Tuh hHat that placed the first piece.

	The closest game scribes noted that Vlankoor Tuh hHat began to vibrate
at a higher rate than he had been only moments before and it was this
vibration that compeled him. He brushed his finger tips across the floor 
around himself disturbing and moving the pieces that formed a thin layer of
chunky debris. He picked up an artifact representing and embodying
STRUCTURE (in fact a condensed form of the Ideal Archetypal) and placed it
upon a node on the topmost of the Games three layers. K'bah-lin (along with
all others present) noticed the conservative nature of Vlankoor's opening
and titled his head slightly to one side to express his acceptance as to
its impulsive authenticity. K'bah-lin's placement of COHERENCE was, as far,
as responses go, equally conservative. When K'bah-lin gingerly placed his
artifact on the Net a line of light traveled between the pieces along the
shortest route made by the clear strands that had previously stretched 
in semi-transperent, milky opacity. On the bottom-most layer corresponding 
motes coalesced, stretchingn and seemingly aching...yearning to reach up
towards the artifacts that, in their turn, dripped drops of glowing plasma 
towards them and when they made contact at the center layer a small spark 
was lit. This spark was a melding of the top layers universiality and the 
bottom layers transient ephemerality. The middle emanation then shot a thin
strand of energetic particles at the Sphere and it grew a very small
measure in size, and just as imperceptably, it began to rotate along its
axis.
