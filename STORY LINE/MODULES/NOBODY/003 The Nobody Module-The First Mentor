The Power of Stewardship

GENRE BEND: 1950s Military training manual - Headstart preschool book 


You're great great great grandfather was a Texas Ranger. We don't know
his real name because someone in the family stole the grave marker that
had it along with the Ranger Star on it. But, he was a Ranger. This would 
have been back in the days when they were still going around alone or with 
a single partner. They would ride into a town that was completely lawless,
with whorehouses and too much crime and they would be given the authority
to do whatever they needed to uphold law and order. 

When he was a little baby he was kidnapped by the indians and they raised
him as one of their own. Now his mother got very sad about this and she 
went to a man that owned the biggest ranch in that part of Texas and 
because he was influential and connected he had some pull with the local 
band of Commanches. So, to make him help her she went to him and gave him
a very expensive saddle with lots of those silver conch shells on them. No, 
I don't know how she got it only that their family was well off enough to 
be able to give him the bribe. 

He agreed to help and he went off and found the Indians and the boy, but
there was an woman that had grown attached to him and considered 
him her own son now. The man wanted to keep the saddle with the conch 
shells and he was able to convince the tribe to convince her to give 
him the boy, but she made it a condition that the boy would come back
and live with her for a few months at a time and that's how he learned 
to be a cowboy and a scout at the same time and that's how come when he
got older he had a wife and mistress. He had grown accustomed to having
two women fight for his love and companionship.

"Your grandmother got into a fight with a witch in a nearby town. Her head
spun around and her tongue stretched down to her knees. She doesn't like to
talk about it."

They stop at the old man's house on the way to the ranch. 

The Nobody is forced to kill a man here and this is his Achille's heel / Moses 
moment that the Scion (or someone else?) will use against him later on.
