STORY IDEA: Each of the mentors deals with a strengthening of a subset of the 
nobody's attributes. He can specialize in one of the school's specialties 
or assign points and fine tune it. Specializing in one gives a bonus and some 
drawbacks in others?

A module begins with a story, sessions end with a puzzle, question, 
or research the player must do in the interim, a module ends with 
a moral or admonition (MAXIM) that accompanies a LEVEL UP.

Each module comes in a box with props, handouts, custom probability dice, etc.
