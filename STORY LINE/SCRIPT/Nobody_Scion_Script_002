# FROM Prologue 000 - Jules Has a Dream

FADE UP. 
														
INT HOSPITAL ROOM (DAY)

JULES' P.O.V. 

Through the eyes of Jules we see the ceiling light of a hospital room. A
NURSE comes into frame and looks directly into the camera. 

								NURSE
					How do you feel? 

Camera focus goes back and forth between sharp and soft a few times. 

								NURSE
							(continuing)
					You're doing fine now and will be 
					getting released after you speak with
					the doctor. 

Jules sits up and directly faces the nurse who is still talking. The camera
tilts down slightly and we see an IV in Jules' arm. 

								NURSE
							(continuing)
					You're lucky your friend here was able 
					to get you here quickly. You'd probably 
					still be on the floor at your job if it 
					wasn't for him. 

The nurse moves out of the way revealing the MAN IN BLACK sitting in a chair
against a far wall. The nurse exits the room. 
											
															CUT TO: 
WIDE-SHOT

Jules and the Man in Black look at each other across the now empty and quiet
room. 

								JULES
						What happened? 

								MAN IN BLACK
						I'm not sure. One moment you were
						telling me it was closing time and 
						the next you were on the floor.
