The nobody has to be seen as the type of person (in the early 
modules) that would easily fall for and be manipulated by the 
later tactics of the illuminati.

Tactic: entertainment - establish a pattern than change the 
context. 

Eg. Find gifts on public street then find one in a locker room. 
Boom. You're a thief because you assumed it was a gift.

Eg. Smoking pot is fine. Helping people is fine. But, how about 
helping a hot minor with down syndrome home cause she is confused 
when you pass her at a bus stop on your way home. On the walk she 
lights a joint and offers you some. She said she was 19. Here come 
the cops. "What do you mean you were smoking pot with a minor that's 
mentally incapacitated and high? Just walking her home, huh? You're just a nice 
guy, huh?"

Dec 16 Sun
The power of concentration, focus, and attention. Different ways for each 
protagonist; hunting, meditation, photography, law enforcment, military, 
dangerous sports, performing art, etc


Saving Throws based on above. Saving throw fails result in Insanity, Anger, 
Depression, Doubt, Greed, Lust, Insanity, Confusion, and Panic.

Game mechanic: 

Objects, encounters, events, and information are triggers.

Each trigger is assigned a stressor level in addition to its special type. 

Depending on the special type the player uses their abilities (native and/or 
in-game (based on defensive choices, i.e. skill tree branches) to make a 
decision and cope with the stressor. 

STORY IDEA: Each of the mentors deals with a strengthening of a subset of the 
nobody's attributes. He can specialize in one of the school's specialties 
or assign points and fine tune it. Specializing in one gives a bonus and some 
drawbacks in others?


In addition to Scope (street to cosmic) there are the layers of reality 
and irreality. 

That *is* a homeless person sitting there, but it's also a feral that is about to *physically assault* you. That's just a lonely dork, but it's also an extremely dangerous psychic vampire that's looking to mind blast you into literal immobility for 48-72 hours.

ADVERSARIES: have I included sirens and succubus yet?

The player must be engaged and challenged on the psycho-emotional levels and not just the maudlin reflexive. The player must undergo catharsis and radical, personal transformation in order for there to be a profound artistic experience. Anything less than this is diversion and pandering and childish wish-fulfilment.

NOBODY/SCION ADV. & DISADV.:

As the nobody ascends he more intimately connects with the egregore hivemind meaning he loses his psychic privacy. The scion degrades physically and mentally all at once w/o constant and ever more costly age inhibition treatments.

MECHANIC: The GM will occasionally narrate a thought the character will have for later use by an NPC,  or either player.

Although you can choose either character...here take this test to see which one you would prefer.

Incorporate chose your own adventure into literature.

And pop-up book?

RE: PLAYER PERSONALITY TEST TO DETERMINE CHARACTER

1) maybe just one super important question after the generic description of the nursery and crib.

The answer determines nobody or scion and what the rest of that module will be like.

Gotta include motivation for each in addition to their human foibles i.e.the nobody is dealing with unknowns and is an existential threat to humanity vs. the nobody is instrumental in bringing about the next stage of human evolution and development. For the scion this is change for the worse and a threat, for the nobody it is a gift and a service.

Subtype of confusion: disonance

Add LAW to list of apptitudes and skills. Also add POLICE PROCEDURE, INTELLIGENCE AGENCY METHODS, and NEWS GATHERING/RESEARCH

ADVERSARIES:
(Real) hackers, intelligence agencies, homeless (and other CI), the unsuspecting bumbler, the useful idiot
(Irreal) proxies, magicians, psions

Results of failing saving throws:
Panic
Dominated
Terrified
Depressed
Illness
Self-incrimination/crazy talk 
Temporary or permanent psychotic break
Confused
Violent/belligerent
Hyper-stoic

A module begins with a story, sessions end with a puzzle, question, 
or research the player must do in the interim, a module ends with 
a moral or admonition (MAXIM) that accompanies a LEVEL UP.

NOBODY ABILITIES:

Mundane
 
Hyper focus
Total vigilance
Lie detection
Courage 
Resilience
Good will
Intention
Problem solving
Intelligence
Charisma

Supramundane 

Sense danger
Precognition
Internal energy manipulation
External energy manipulation (shield, throwing)
Mind blast
Confuse
Intimidate
Frustrate
Weather control
Natural disaster control
Major and minor manmade catastrophe and mayem
Disease control
Space weather and associated phenomena
Time-magic
General Probability bending
Reality bending
Mind control at a distance and a stranger 

No mind control(personal only), proxies, or sadness induction.

Each module comes in a box with props, handouts, custom probability dice, etc.

Seperate file: a thousand examples of the nobody's goodness

Introduce FATAL FLAW / HUBRIS and TRIGGER mechanics.

GM: introduce method acting concept of goal, obstacle, other, etc to properly immerse and motivate the gamer as the player character...to meld them.

The GM asks trick questions to determine the direction if the gameplay --the GM as trickster archetype, and as fairy godmother archetype.

MECHANIC: Demeaned/belittled affects doubt and confidence 

Add vampire drip hybrid type.

In addition to scope / domain there is scope / realm. Realm is socio-industrial in nature. Could be church, fashion scene, industry, school, or moveable TAZ.
